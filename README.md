# guessing_number_game

“Guess the Number” game. The computer will think of a random number, and ask you to guess it. The computer will tell you if each guess is too high or too low. You win if you can guess the number within five tries.


This is a good game to code because it uses random numbers, loops, and input from the user in a short program. You’ll learn how to convert values to different data types, and why you would need to do this. Since this program is a game, we’ll call the user the player. But “user” would be correct too.
